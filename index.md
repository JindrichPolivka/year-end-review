# Year End Review

## 1) What did you like most about this course?
You were very approachable and kept a light friendly atmosphere. And I liked how much freedom you gave us in carrying out our assignments.
##2) What did you like least about this course?
Sometimes the class would drag on a bit.
## 3) What were the top (three) things you learned this year?
- work with github
- how to present myself. And bring a personal touch to it while staying proffesional.
- Importance of accessability
## 4) What was the most memorable activity/assignment?
The group tasks were when i had the most fun in class. But the most memorable might be the storyrelling presentations as it was difficult for me, but also interestign to see how others have tackled it.
## 5) What’s something you accomplished this year that you are most proud of?
idk, didn't accomplish much
## 6) What’s one thing you learned about yourself?
That I should be more open and not so defensive about giving others the ooportunity to judge me. They're just gonna judge me for that then, i think
## 7) What’s one thing you could have done better?
Give more feedback to others. The nervousness of whoever is presenting made me feel tense and i had a hard time finding the courage to break through it, even when i had something positive to say.
## 8) What’s one thing I could have done better?
Get the class to engage a bit more. This somewhat falls on us, the students. But i think if you forced us to talk a bit more we would appreciate it in the end.
## 9) What’s one thing you would add or change about this course?
More in-class assignments, ideally group tasks. The class is quite long and it can get diificult to focus on your presentation or wathing videos in class for hours. The few times we had those kinds of tasks it always made me feel energized and I could get more out of the rest of the class.
## 10) What advice would you give to students taking this course next year?
have fun
